Resources
> Resources are called "alloys" which can be mined from
 asteroids and planets
> Mining ships enter orbit above a planet and start "mining"
 > in that they are stationary around the planet, and some
  animation plays that shows the ship mining
  
Population Management
> Many RTSes implement population management to add another
 layer of gameplay, base management and a way to control the
 size of armies so they don't get too big too fast. We can
 implement that here, but I don't know what form it would take.
 Would your population cap (and thus how many units you can have)
 based on how many planets you control? What if there are very
 few planets? Should the players be allowed to build base
 structures? If so, we haven't even gotten to that yet
 
 
Unit Stats
> Integrity (health)
> Shielding (shields)
> Speed
> Plating (armor)
> Attacks
> Resource Cost
> Training Time

Units
> Masters (Aliens)
 > Mining Ship
> Slaves (Humans)
 > Mining Ship - the resource gatherer of the army, which is
  does not have any attacks of its own, low shielding, integrity,
  and plating.
 > Scout Ship - The scout ship is an inexpensive, fast moving and
  lightly armed and armored. These ships are useful early on for
  hit and run attacks on the enemy and scouting their location, but
  are easily outclassed by heavier warships
 > Frigate - The frigate is useful for small skirmishes and escort
  duty for bigger warships. It has a good balance between speed,
  firepower and resilience, and several can take down a battleship
 > Battleship - The battleship is the mainstay of large spaceborne
  engagements. Slower than the frigate, but heavily armed with both
  missile and laser weapons, the battleship can take on multiple
  opponents at once and win.
 > Dreadnought - Everything the dreadnought sacrifices in speed, it
  makes up for it sheer long range firepower.
 > (Carrier) - Don't know if this should be implemented
