Game Concept: We are shooting for a Space/Sci-Fi theme, with some focus on exploration and character progression through storyline progression and some crafting/side-quest type thing. The game will most likely be in 2.5D, so we can make it look nice with high quality sprites/models and be able to make it FEEL 3D by changing things (i.e. environmental ambiance like trees, perhaps?) in the foreground and background of the character.

Plot Line: Slave that escapes from alien captors, frees others and fights 
back against masters

Main character is the player, a member of human race. Description:
> Sex: Yes please (but really I'd like to do a female main character)
> Complexion: Dark
> Hair Color: Black
> Eye Color: Brown (Maybe Blue or Green? OR BOTH? - Tom)
> Physique: Gaunt (thinner due to malnutrition)

Major Plot Points (PC = player character/player of the game):
> PC is slave of an alien race. PC attempts escape from alien captors
> PC escapes from alien prison, commandeers a ship and escapes planet
> PC finds out that there are other prisons on other planets, and resolves
 to go to those other worlds and free other prisoners
> PC goes to another world, and frees a group of humans, and escape on the
 commandeered ship
> PC and other humans resolve to fight back against their captors
> PC frees more prisoners, building up their forces for more straight up
 confrontations with the aliens, instead of guerilla strikes
> PC ends up winning enough battles to fight the leader of the aliens
  > this is set to be the last fight, and the end of the game

Story Notes/Personal Thoughts
> I'd really like to do a female main character, just to make things
 different
> I was experimenting with the idea of the aliens also messing with the
 minds of their slaves (for instance "wiping" their minds of any memories
 of their previous life, and the PC would little by little figure out
 who they were and what they did before being captured)
  > This mind tampering would bring up a lot of ethical issues and really
   give the character an internal battle in addition to the external one
   being fought for her freedom and that of others
