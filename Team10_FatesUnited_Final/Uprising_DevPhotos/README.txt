This README will be used to briefly describe each screen shot we have of our game throughout the development phase.

00 - This is our initial scene in which we were using to test networking, connecting a client to a host and making sure there weren't any issues there.

01 - This is our first look at the in-game GUI. Kostanza will be where our mini-map is going to be and the buttons labelled "ASS" are the keys corresponding to QWER, ASDF, ZXCV from top to bottom. 
The info panel in the middle will be used for more detailed ship information like statistics and multi-unit selection.

02 - Unity screen shot of the [Fates United] logo. 

03 - Screen shot of our initial icon for the .exe file, using our beloved Kostanza.

04 - This is our title screen, showing the game logo.

05 - This screen shot is of the initial graphics/input configuration screen that shows up. This is no longer a window that shows up, those settings were changed. Default is windowed at 1280x1024 permanently.

06 - This was our initial resolution test of the credits screen. Kostanza is no longer located here.

07 - Screen shot of our main menu with buttons, this was near our final set-up. Credits was moved into the options menu.

08 - Screen shot of the mini-map along with error messages that show up when you try to build something with not enough resources.

09 - Another look at the error messages, this was the initial error test.

10 - Screen shot of all possible ships to fly with, before they were textured.
